Seriously though, it pulls the list of bank names from the FDIC's APIs, and lists the most common words in bank names (not filtering out stopwords, because I wrote this on holiday in response to an idle brainstorm over brunch, come on). The eleven most common words, as of mid-January 2019: 

* Bank 155387
* of 38368
* State 30048
* First 24959
* National 24832
* The 24160
* Trust 16684
* Savings 16062
* and 12288
* Company 10628
* Association 9566
