Seriously though, it pulls the list of bank names from the FDIC's APIs, and lists the most common words in bank names (not filtering out stopwords, because I wrote this on holiday in response to an idle brainstorm over brunch, come on). The eleven most common words, as of early April 2019: 

* Bank 4937
* of 1195
* State 936
* First 779
* National 775
* The 752
* Trust 526
* Savings 503
* and 384
* Company 339
* Association 302
